* Uniques
  * Primal Savagery [River Warlord] Recieve Triple Gold from Barbarian encampments and pillaging Cities. Embarked Units can defend themselves.
  >The lives of primeval Humans were of harsher and brutal times. Having been tempered by this environment, Neanderthals would have been no doubt extraordinary in brutality, physique and strength.
  
  * Savage [Replaces Scout] A unique ancient-era unit replacing the scout. Opting for less early-game visibility for an above-average offensive unit.
  >Although much more primitive and less-forward thinking. Neanderthals compared to Humans were more stronger and bulkier than their upright-standing counterparts.
  
  * Clubber [Replaces Warrior] A unique ancient-era unit replacing the Warrior. Enhancing the Neanderthal's early-game conquest goals by having an offensive-focused unit.
  >Tools and craftsmanship, although inferior to the Homo Sapien, were still formidable in their own right. Being utilized primarily for domestic hunting and combat purposes.
